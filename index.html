				<h2>Hello hello!</h2>

				<p>Lover of Fashion, International Relations and International Economics. In my free time, I usually post some cool content on my social media and write out of love what doesn't fit in my heart, 'cause it's a way to relieve what's inside.</p>

				<h3>Fashion</h3>
				<img src="images/fashion.jpg" width="400px" border= "1" hspace="1" alt="Fashion">
				<p>I've been interested in fashion-related subjects for a while, however, after starting my graduation thesis in my home country, I started to research the subject even more. My focus has always been makeup, as I thought it was amazing to be able to draw and mix all the colors when doing face or body makeup. But, by studying more about how both subjects are linked, I couldn't help but fall in love with the fashion universe.
				In this perspective, I believe that this market is very important and that it expresses things that go far beyond the creation of designs and pieces annually. I see fashion as a way of expressing myself as well as other existing arts and I admire the professionals who make the shows happen frequently.</p>

				<h3>International Relations</h3>
				<img src="images/ri.png" width="400px" border= "1" hspace="1" alt="Fashion">
				<p>After studying cinema and advertising at the university for two years, I decided to change my degree, because I felt satisfaction in imagining the construction of my career in the area of communication. So, I decided to look for another course and that's when I found out about the International Relations course at PUC Minas in Brazil. I was delighted as the main subjects interested me a lot, such as diplomacy, international cooperation and international political economy. I am passionate about my course and it is thanks to it and the power of diplomatic relations that I am here today doing my exchange program in France.</p>

				<h3>International Political Economy</h3>
				<img src="images/economy.jpg" width="400px" border= "1" hspace="1" alt="Fashion">
				<p>Since I have always been interested in issues related to the economic development of countries and my undergraduate course has enabled me to do so, I have focused a lot on this area of knowledge in recent years. I see this field in a divided way, where the power struggle is sometimes seen as more important than the development of a nation. In this perspective, I seek to develop critical analyzes regarding economic issues and participate in extension projects in my country that give me the freedom to carry out research related to international political economy.</p>
